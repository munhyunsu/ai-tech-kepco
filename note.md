# The problem solving artificial intelligence technology development

## Goal about this class
- Incubate junior developer

## What is artificial intelligence
- Intelligently automation
- High-level decision making

## AI company case study
- CB Insights: Top 100 company at specific markets

## Machine learning
- Not just a lot of rules
- Too many rules to can not code

# Tensorflow

## Data flow graph
- Graph formed mathmatic formula

## Hypothesis using matrix
- Dot product with feature and weight matrix
- We need a shape of feature(weight) matrix
  - ex) [5, 3] * [3, 4] = [5, 4]
  - ex) [n, 3] * [?, ?] = [n, 2]

## Linear regression
- Y = XW+b

## Logistic regression
- Y = W\*sigmoid(z)

### Sigmoid and Softmax
- Sigmoid: 0~1
- Softmax: Multiple logistic regression
  - Scores to probabilities
